## UI-UX-Experiment2
## Aim:
To design an elegant, modern, and eco-conscious digital interface for “GreenSip Smoothies”, a brand specializing in organic, fresh, and healthy beverages. The goal is to reflect freshness, sustainability, and vitality through colors, layout, and interactive elements, ensuring a seamless experience on both web and mobile platforms.

## Algorithm:
1.I began by choosing a clean white artboard in Figma to design the logo.

2.I added a leaf icon to represent freshness and nature, and filled it with a green gradient.

3.I typed the brand name “GreenTaste” using a bold sans-serif font in dark green (#1B5E20).

4.Below it, I added “SMOOTHIES” in uppercase with a lighter green color (#4CAF50) and spaced letters evenly.

5.I aligned all elements neatly and adjusted spacing for balance.

6.Finally, I exported the logo in PNG format with a transparent background.

## Output:

<img width="675" height="245" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8c9561-1f25-478e-bbcc-b3f6e16efb25" />


## Result:
The GreenSip Smoothies web and mobile layout is successfully designed with a fresh, health-oriented aesthetic, delivering a consistent, interactive, and visually energizing experience that promotes organic living and enhances customer engagement.
